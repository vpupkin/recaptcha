### MODx ###
Recaptcha can be incorporated into the eForm and SPForm components of MODx by following these tutorials :

For eForm : http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,41869.msg252530.html#msg252530

For SPForm : http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,42131.0.html

An example of using Mailhide can be found here : http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,42270.0.html

In all cases, the recaptchalib.php file was located in assets/snippets/recaptcha, though this can be changed.
Private/public keys were also stored there for convenience.  Should any issues be found with this implementation over time, notice will most likely be found in those forum threads.

### Plone ###

There is now a reCaptcha (collective.recaptcha) add-on product for Plone, the popular open-source content management system, written by David Glick.  It is available for download at:

> http://plone.org/products/collective.recaptcha

It is based on the recaptcha-client Python library.

We've tagged the current release as beta, but we do have it in production use, believe it to be bug-free, and will likely tag a final release very soon.

### reCAPTCHA as a Web Service ###
I have implemented [reCAPTCHA as a web service](http://looseassociations.com/ReCAPTCHAasAService), providing a simple way to add reCAPTCHA to sites/platforms without modifying CGI code. It isn't ideal -- plugins would be preferred whenever available -- but it brings reCAPTCHA to sites where no plugin is available (TWiki in my case) and site operators are unable or unwilling to modify code.
