Complains about reCAPTCHA on Google Groups

# Introduction #

The Google Groups group for reCAPTCHA is a free resource for those implementing reCAPTCHA, and is largely 'manned' by (a very small group of) third parties who have successfully implemented reCAPTCHA on their own sites, and are willing, for free, to give advice to others trying to do the same.

What the group is not, is a place to vent your disagreement about CAPTCHAs in general, or about reCAPTCHA specifically.

A lot of people dislike CAPTCHAs.

A lot of people dislike spam.

Unfortunately, due to how the web works these days, there are more communications by spammers than people who'd like to have their internet spam free.

CAPTCHAs are an attempt to stop the spam. Some work, some don't, some are in the grey bit in the middle and reCAPTCHA seems to annoy quite a few people occasionally (changes in the distortion for example.)

Those of us who regularly contribute to the group are in the latter group, and have decided to use reCAPTCHA as part of the defense against spammers.

Regular contributors to the group are not employees of Google. We have no influence over the content of the images.

Complaining on-group about reCAPTCHA is, at best, going to be ignored. At worst, it's going to turn into a long tedious thread that serves neither party.
